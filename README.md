## working 

It is just an normal react app with tsx and tailwindcss  
under src folder two folders are there ui and ide  
ui is for developing ui  
ide is for electron  

what happens when we run electron  
first we need to build the react vite app (npm run build)  
and the builded app will be under the dist-ui folder and then we are serving it to our electron this is what happening  

to test ui  
npm run dev:ui - it will open in your browser  

to test electron ui  
npm run dev:ide - a new window will open
